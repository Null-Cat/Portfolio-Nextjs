      <p>
        I&apos;m a Game Programmer Graduate from Falmouth University with
        proficient experience in game engines such as Unreal Engine and Unity
        using languages such as C++ and C#. I am an aspiring Gameplay Programmer
        looking for a challenging role to express my skills. In my personal
        projects, I tinker with web development (backend) node.js such as this
        site which is deployed on my Raspberry Pi using PM2 and Nginx. I also
        have experience with javascript game engines such as Phaser.
